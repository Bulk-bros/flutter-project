## Good

### Functionality

- Good that you can overwrite recommended macros

### Design

- Good layout, simple and clear
- Logically information distribution
- Intuitive navigation
- Nice color palett, healthy color
- Good contrasts, some grey color was a little bit hard to read

**Color blindness:** Have tested colors in a [colorblind simulator](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/), everthing looks fine

**Thumb reachability:** Have looked through the app and thought of thumb reachability for easy access. Everything looked fine, a few compromises in "not that important" places.
