## Walkthrough
- Feels like the landing sign-up page is too direct
- The landing sign-up page is a bit bland
- Went for email first
- Forgot password and login on the top right was in the sign-up page
- Grammar error "I have read and agree the Terms of Service" and would like a link to the terms and service
- Would like a selector for the Date of birth like a calendar
- Recommended calorie consumption with an * for an adult
- Units for the consumption confused, is it grams? litres?
- Would like to see kg instead of percentage on How much do you want to gain/lose and then present a percentage
people struggle with maths.

## Questions

### Functionality

- Missing units when completing setup, also re-wording of greyed text.
- Would love to see nutrition for ingredients in the create new meal
- Not sure if you'd want to display the height, doesn't change.
- Recommended meal to fill out the remaining daily quota calories.
- Click on weight and see a graph (next to your profile)
- Weight with a decimal
- Replace height with goal weight
- Wants to see a settings menu to change profile settings
- Imperial not just metric (NA support)
- Too much space next to Today's meals
- Animations for the pie charts when loading in
- Swipe to the right to see today's meals, since the landing is today's macros
- Info when clicking on: Proteins, carbs, and fat. Like what are some great things to eat, EEAs, fats to eat etc.
- If not, enough nutrients were met, mark them in a colour such as red

### Design
- Liked the green and white.
- The text wasn't hard to read, but make the grey text slightly darker
- Doesn't feel like a high contrast/dark version is needed
- Intuitive enough, felt "fine"
- Create new meal button should be highlighted more than the cancel button, make it for instance bold.
- Make the daily log a bit bigger, and so that 7 blocks fit in and the text bigger so it's easier to see.
- Yearly is just a bit too much in the log, would rather see quarterly.
