## Walt through

- Easy to navigate
- Nice that you can overwrite the recommended macros
  - I had to tell him that he could do it if he wanted to. Not that intuitive, since it just looks like plane text (ref figma: setup - 5). Solution could be to add an editing icon or something to make it more clear
